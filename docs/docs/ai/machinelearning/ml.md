Twister2-ML provides a set of machine learning algorithms using in-built communication APIs. We
 have implemented KMeans and Support Vector Machine(SVM) with a distributed data parallel model
 . In our upcoming releases we will be providing more support for distributed ML algorithms with
  state of the art ML libraries.
