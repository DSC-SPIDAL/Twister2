// a note:
// oneof structs are added to workerID fields
// main reason is to force the workerID to be encoded and logged when its value is zero.
// if we do not use oneof, the value zero is not logged.
// The reason for that seems to be that zero is the default value,
// and it is not encoded and transferred.
//
// an advantage of this solution is that each message must have workerID field set.
// that is positive I think.
